## What Does This Project Do?
**Hephaestus** is a personal project designed to help users make informed decisions about household appliances. The application evaluates the condition and damage of the appliance and provides a recommendation on what action to take. 

The project consists of two components:
 - Frontend built with Angular ( **you are here üìç** )
 - Backend developed using Java

The frontend application is deployed on **GitHub Pages** and is accessible here:

- **[Live Application](https://cristeaibogdan.github.io/hephaestus-web/)**  
  Access the live version of the Hephaestus application, where you can interact with the user interface and make informed appliance decisions.
  
  **Backend is hosted on Azure with a burst configuration, which means it may temporarily shut down when idle. If the service doesn't respond immediately, try refreshing a few times to wake it up.**

- **[Zipkin Server on Azure](https://zipkin.kindmeadow-812476e6.northeurope.azurecontainerapps.io)**  
  Access Zipkin to monitor requests in real-time and trace how the frontend interacts with the backend.

## Technologies Used
* **Angular 15** - The frontend is written in Angular 15, a framework for building efficient single-page applications (SPAs).
* **Angular Material** - Offers a set of reusable UI components based on Material Design. Used to enhance the user interface with a modern look and feel.
* **Reactive Forms** - Facilitates handling of form inputs and validations through a reactive programming approach.
* **Custom Sync Validators** - Implemented to enforce business logic and ensure that form data meets specific requirements.
* **Custom Async Validators** - Used for backend validation, allowing asynchronous checks on form inputs against server data.
* **Interceptors** - Used for: set header for the selected language, display loading indicator and set a predefined timeout to each request.
* **ZXing** - A library for scanning and decoding barcodes and QR codes.
* **i18n** - Supports internationalization, making the application adaptable for various languages and regions.
